      You lack the clearance for that information, citizen.  Further
      inquiries are not compatible with your physical well-being. The
      computer is your friend!

      Welcome to Paranoia!
      HOW TO PLAY:
        Always choose the least dangerous option.  Continue doing this until
        you win. At times you will use a skill or engage in combat and and will
        be informed of the outcome.  These sections will be self explanatory.
      HOW TO DIE:
        As Philo-R-DMD you will die at times during the adventure. When this
        happens you will be given a new clone at a particular location. The new
        Philo-R will usually have to retrace some of the old Philo-R's path;
        hopefully they won't make the same mistake as their predecessor.
      HOW TO WIN:
        Simply complete the mission before you expend all six clones. If you
        make it, congratulations. If not, you can try again later.

      You wake up face down on the red and pink checked E-Z-Kleen linoleum floor.
      You recognise the pattern, it's the type preferred in the internal security
      briefing cells.  When you finally look around you, you see that you are alone
      in a large mission briefing room.
    buttons: [{title: "Continue", payload: "/continue"}]

  - text: |
      In the center of the room is a table and a single chair.  There is an
      Orange folder on the table top, but you can't make out the lettering on
      it.
    buttons:
    - {title: "You sit down and read the folder.", payload: "/read_orange_folder"}
    - {title: "You leave the room.", payload: "/leave_briefing_room"}

      The printing on the folder says "Experimental Self Briefing."
      You open it and begin to read the following:
      Step 1: Compel the briefing subject to attend the briefing.
          NOTE: See Experimental Briefing Sub Form Indigo-WY-2, 'Experimental
                Self Briefing Subject Acquisition Through The Use Of Neurotoxin
                Room Foggers.'
      Step 2: Inform the briefing subject that the briefing has begun.
          ATTENTION: THE BRIEFING HAS BEGUN.
      Step 3: Present the briefing material to the briefing subject.
          GREETINGS TROUBLESHOOTER.

          LOCATE THEIR RINGLEADER, AN UNKNOWN MASTER RETAILER, AND BRING HIM
          BACK FOR EXECUTION AND TRIAL.  THANK YOU.  THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND.
      Step 4: Sign the briefing subject's briefing release form to indicate that
            the briefing subject has completed the briefing.
            ATTENTION: PLEASE SIGN YOUR BRIEFING RELEASE FORM.
      Step 5: Terminate the briefing
            ATTENTION: THE BRIEFING IS TERMINATED.

      You walk to the door and hold your signed briefing release form up to the
      plexiglass window.  A guard scrutinises it for a moment and then slides
      back the megabolts holding the door shut.  You are now free to continue
      the mission.
    buttons:

      You walk up to the door and push the button labelled "push to exit."
      Within seconds a surly looking guard shoves his face into the small plexiglass
      window.  You can see his mouth forming words but you can\'t hear any of them.
      You just stare at him blankly  for a few moments until he points down to a
      speaker on your side of the door.  When you put your ear to it you can barely
      hear him say, \"Let\'s see your briefing release form, bud.  You aren't
      getting out of here without it.\"
